## :computer: Week `2` Programming Assignment 3

:white_check_mark: **Exercise 2.3)**<br>
***Complete the code segment to call `print()` method of class `Question` by creating a method named `studentMethod()`.***

```java
// This is the main class Question
public class Question23
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
		// Object of the main class is created
		Question23 q = new Question23();
		// Print method on object of Question class is called
		q.studentMethod();
    }
    
	// 'print()' method is defined in class Question
	void print(Question23 object)
	{
		System.out.print("Well Done!");
	}
    /********************/
    // Define a method named 'studentMethod()' in class Question
    void studentMethod()
    {
        // Call the method named 'print()' in class Question
        print(this);
    }
    /********************/
}
```
â–¸ **Explanation:** The `this` keyword can be used for calling another constructor in the same class as the first part of your constructor.
